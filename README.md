# Linear-Search
### This program implements linear search in C language. It first initializes an array of integers with five values and prompts the user to enter the element to be searched. If the user input is greater than the largest element in the array, the program prints "Element not found" and returns -1. Otherwise, it iterates through each element of the array and compares it with the user input. If it finds a match, it prints "Found" and the index of the element in the array. If the element is not found, the program prints "Element not found" and returns -1. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
